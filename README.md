# MIPSSequenceFinder
A MIPS assembly program takes one input from an input file, this is an integer array. This program finds a sequence according to increasing order, this program can find more than one sequence but has to return only one sequence that has a maximum length.  The outputs of the program are the sequence and the length of the array, the outputs should be written the file.
 
 Example: Array_inp: [3, 10, 7, 9, 4, 11], Array_outp: [3, 7, 9, 11] size = 4
